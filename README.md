# A Material

A material repo would contain study material.
The README would include setup instructions for the materials and a study-guide pacing a student's progress through the material chapters.

The [/.study](./.study) folder contains info about the module including learning objectives, deliverables, ... just check it out.
Files in the `/.study` folder can be hosted or fetched to render the home page for a class [like this](https://home.hackyourfuture.be/curriculum/agile-development).
(Home repos could come with the code necessary to become a gitbook when github pages is turned on, using the modules data to render the chapters.)

this repo has topics, but it could be anything.

> self-assessments should fit in here somehow
