# A Module

A module repo would contain all the self-hosted materials for a module.
The README would include setup instructions for the materials and a study-guide pacing a student's progress through the module chapters.

The [/docs](./docs) folder contains info about the module including learning objectives, deliverables, ... just check it out.
Files in the `/docs` folder can be hosed on github pages and can be fetched to render the home page for a class [like this](https://home.hackyourfuture.be/curriculum/agile-development).
(Home repos could come with the code necessary to become a gitbook when github pages is turned on, using the modules data to render the chapters.)

> self-assessments should fit in here somehow
